React is a Component-Based, Declarative, state-driven Javascript library.

Declarative :- tell how component work and look by current data/state using declarative syntax called JSX (HTML, javascript ,CSS and referencing other components).

React is just library as it is only view layer we need other external library to build complete application i.e :- routing, data fetching

NEXT.js and Remix are framework that has all the built in feature i.e :- routing, data fetching and server side rendering.

Rerendering is done through Virtual Dom, Fiber tree, and one-way data flow.
