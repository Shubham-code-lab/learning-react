React is a Component-Based, Declarative, state-driven Javascript library.

Declarative :- tell how component work and look by current data/state using declarative syntax called JSX (HTML, javascript ,CSS and referencing other components).

React is just library as it is only view layer we need other external library to build complete application i.e :- routing, data fetching

NEXT.js and Remix are framework that has all the built in feature i.e :- routing, data fetching and server side rendering.

Rerendering is done through Virtual Dom, Fiber tree, and one-way data flow.

npx create-react-app@5 pizza-menu
npm start

TIPS :-
use event handler only when you want to run the code on state and props changes or onclick
use useEffect when you want executing some sync code or after component life cycle
pass arrow function when you are working with current value of state
//pass set event handler to child component that child component will have it own event handler which will do some job and pass some data to this set event handler of parent.
//never mutate object in setState() replace them
//use lazy evaluation call back function to setState() when we want to set initial state.
//use useEffect that trigger on certain state update to update external things
//use one a single hooks for specific logic
//any hooks that you use in useEffect should be part of your dependency.
