//Redux(standalone library hence can be also used with vanilla javascript)
//third party library to manage global state in a web app
//react-redux library is easy to integrate.
//All global state is stored in one globally accessible store, which is easy to update using "actions" (like useReducer).
//It is similar to using context API + useReducer.
//Two ways to write :- 1] Classic Redux, 2] Modern Redux Toolkit.

//use when lot of global UI(not from server/remote state) state need to be updated frequently.
//now a days in most of the app global state is remote. so redux is not used.

//useReducer :-
//when we want to update state from event handler we first create action object {type, payload} then we dispatch action to reducer function which 
//uses current state to calculate next state and re-render the component which uses these

//In redux we dispatch using the "ACTION creator function"(a convention(no must) to automate writing action to centralize all possible actions) to store instead to reducer function.
//store is single source of truth of global state it home to one or more reducer.
//Each reducer is a pure function that calculate the next state (state transition) based on he action and the current state. Usually one reducer per app feature (e.g:- shopping cart + user data + theme).


//OLD way code is in BalanceDisplay.js
//useSelector and useDispatch is modern react
//before these hook we had to use Connect API.

//Redux middleware and Thunks :-
//we can make API call in reducer function as they have to be pure.
//redux store only dispatch sync action and update the state.
//middleware(redux thunks) a function that sits between dispatching the action and the store. Allows us to run code after dispatching, but before reaching the reducer in the store.
//store.js code in deposit() method

//Redux ToolKit :-
//The modern and preferred way to writing Redux code.
//An opinionated approach, forcing us to use Redux best practices.
//less code and can combine with classic redux
//1] we can write the code that "mutate" state inside reducers (will be converted to immutable logic behind the scenes by "Immer" library).
//2] Action creator are automatically created
//3] Automatically setup of thunk middleware and DevTools
