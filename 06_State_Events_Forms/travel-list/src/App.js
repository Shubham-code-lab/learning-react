//Controlled Element :-
//input field maintain their state inside the DOM (inside the HTML element itself). which make it hard to read.
//using controlled element we can store there value in React instead in DOM so react is able to control them using state.

//State :-
//State is internal data, owned by component.
//Component Memory
//Can be updated by the component itself.
//Updating state can causes component to re-render
//Used to make components interactive.

//props :-
//External data owned by parent component.
//similar to function parameters.
//Read-only.
//Receiving new props causes component to re-render. Usually when the parent's state has been updated.
//Used by parent to configure child component ("settings").

//Thinking in state transitions, not element mutation.
//Break the desired UI into components and establish the component tree.
//Build a static version in React (without state).
//State management :- Deciding when to create pieces of state, what types of state are necessary, where to place each piece of state, and how data flows through the app.
//State :- when to use, types of states local vs global. Where to place each piece of state.
//data flow :- one-way data flow, child-to-parent communication, Accessing global state.

//Local state :-
//State needed only by one or few components (child or sibling).
//State that is defined in a component and only that component an child components have access to it (by passing via props)

//Global state :-
//State that many component might need.
//Shared state that is accessible to every component in the entire application.
//define using :- Context API or Redux.

//Inverse data flow :- Child to parent communication.
